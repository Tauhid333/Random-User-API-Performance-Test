## Introduction

WeatherAPI.com interactive API explorer or IO Docs allows you to test our APIs and methods. It returns response headers, response code and response body.
For complete documentation please visit our Weather API Documentation section.

You can also now use our Swagger tool to learn as to how to form weather Request. Visit [Swagger Tool](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/WeatherAPI.com/WeatherAPI/1.0.2)

## Overview

The Weather API provides product data via the endpoint [http://api.weatherapi.com/v1/current.json?key=63e1b2500f9a4d1da62120232241106&q=London&aqi=no](http://api.weatherapi.com/v1/current.json?key=63e1b2500f9a4d1da62120232241106&q=London&aqi=no). Performance testing was conducted to ensure the API can handle various levels of traffic and to identify its maximum capacity.

## Tests Conducted

### Load Test

Load testing was conducted to determine how the API performs under expected user loads. The test aimed to identify response times, throughput, and potential bottlenecks.

### Stress Test

Stress testing was performed to determine the API's behavior under extreme conditions. This test helps identify the point at which the API fails or experiences significant performance degradation.

### Capacity Analysis

Capacity analysis was conducted to establish the maximum number of requests the API can handle before its performance becomes unacceptable or it fails.
